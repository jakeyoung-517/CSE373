# CSE373 Data Structures and Algorithms
The primary focus of this class is on gaining a strong theoretical and conceptual understanding of common data structures and algorithms as well as how they can be practically applied within larger programming projects.

Specific topics covered include:

-Data structures and ADTs: lists, dictionaries, trees, balanced trees, AVL trees, hash tables, priority queues, binary heaps, disjoint sets
-Graphs and graph algorithms: graph search, shortest path, and minimum spanning trees
-Algorithm analysis: asymptotic analysis, locality, P and NP complexity classes
-Sorting and divide-and-conquer
